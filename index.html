      <p class="lb_text">
          This class assignment involved a comprehensive rebranding endeavor for the legendary Billy Beer, culminating in the creation of a responsive website to showcase the brand and its various products, enhanced with dynamic content. The project primarily focused on infusing a fresh identity into the brand while preserving its historical significance. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="lb_text">
          During the initial stages, I took the lead in conceptualization, crafting sketch logos, and defining the brand's color palette. After thoughtful deliberation, we opted for a sophisticated blend of gold and blue, paying homage to the brand's original colors. To add a modern twist, we introduced new flavors, expanding the product range.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="lb_text">
          To visually communicate our vision, we used Cinema 4D to design eye-catching cans and bottles, injecting a contemporary feel into the brand's image. The subsequent step involved leveraging Adobe Creative Suite to create visually appealing posters and banners, aligning with the revamped brand aesthetics.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="lb_text">
          The final phase of the assignment was the website development, where tasks were collaboratively divided. I actively contributed to both the functional and design aspects of the site, employing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The end result is a seamlessly responsive website that encapsulates the essence of the rebranded Billy Beer, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience. This assignment serves as a testament to our collaborative efforts in rejuvenating a classic brand within the constraints of a class project.
